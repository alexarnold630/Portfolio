# Happiness Index Investigation

## Background
Select a real-world data set and perform an Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Objectives

### Select Data
- Kaggle Notebooks:
    - https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/interactive-maps
    - https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report ○ https://www.kaggle.com/londeen/world-happiness-report-2020
- Open Weather API: ​https://openweathermap.org/api
- Google Maps API

### Data Clean-Up
- Used Kaggle Datasets for CSVs for the World Happiness Report from 2015-2020 and gathered data weather from the OpenWeatherMap API based on locations pulled from the Google Maps API
- Merged datasets and formatted the columns based on the variables used to calculate the World Happiness Index that remained consistent over time, such as: 
    - Economy
    - Social Support
    - Health
    - Freedom
    - Trust
    - Generosity
    - Residuals

### Hypotheses
- Happiness has increased over time
- Weather positively affects happiness
- Predict happiness will decrease next year

### Analysis
- Chloropleth Map illustrating Total Happiness Score from 2015-2020
- Histograms and Violin Plots illustrating normal distribution of scores
- ANOVA testing to determined the significance of the Happiness Index Score variables
- Line Charts to investigate the differences between the Top and Bottom Score Countries
- T-tests
- Heat Maps and statistics modeling to determine the correlations between Happiness Index bariables
    - Added weather as a possible correlating factor
- Prediction Modeling using regression

### Conclusions
- Happiness has increased over time
- Weather does not positively affect happiness
- Ability to predict happiness is questionable as it is dependent upon Happiness variables
